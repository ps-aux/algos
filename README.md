# algos [WIP]

Implementations of classic algorithms in various languages. So far: **Java**, **Python** and **Javascript**.

A lot is to be done here since I would like to have visual representation of the algorithm execution.

**Javascript** browser implementation has some half-finished visualization of few sort algorithms, however due to the way how Javascript as language needs to be used to create animation, the algorithm code is full of asynchronous programming and does not resemble the implementations in the other languages.
